# Project - Tic Tac Toe

Tic tac toe is one of the most popular games of the world. 
In this opportuity I developed the logic and interface to play this cool game in two different modes: "Human vs Human" mode and "Human vs AI" mode.

This projects was made with **html**, **css** and **vanilla javascript**. Some of the goals of this projects were:

- Implement and reflect the javascript concepts of: module pattern, factory functions, closure and objects.
- Implement a classical algorithm (minimax) to create an AI that plays the game in the best possible way.
